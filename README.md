## What is AutoFlappy
AutoFlappy is a program that automatically plays Flappy Bird for you, with a bit of setting up, you can easily beat the World Record to most points achieved in Flappy Bird.

## Download
### Cloning
You can clone the repository by doing the following:  
`git clone https://github.com/itsmarsss/AutoFlappy.git`  
You can run it in an IDE or build it into a jar, up to you.
### Lazy download
If you're a lazy bum like me, head over to [[releases]](https://github.com/itsmarsss/AutoFlappy/releases), and download the most recent version.  
Make sure to run the jar file in terminal/command prompt, so you can actually issue commands.  
`java -jar "AutoFlappy-[append version here].jar"`

## Usage
### Options
#### help
Brings up a help menu
#### setup

Once you've started, you cant stop; either close terminal/command prompt or terminate program.

### Recommendation
- Set Window scale to 100%, unless you want the program to scan the void.  

- It is recommended that you use [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/781130082/) Scratch project. I've edited its components to better assist the program in screen reading.
